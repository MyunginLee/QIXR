# About Quantum Intuition XR
Quantum Intuition XR is an interactive, extended reality (XR) experience designed to make quantum concepts tangible. The system visualizes core principles of quantum computing, including qubits, superposition, entanglement, and measurement, through immersive interaction. Using a Mixed Reality headset, users engage with floating qubits, manipulate their states via controllers, and observe entanglement dynamics through real-time audiovisual feedback. A key feature of the implementation is the mathematically accurate and dynamic representation of qubits, both individually and while interacting with each other. The visualization of the qubit states evolve—rotate, shrink, grow, entangle—depending on their actual quantum states, which depend on variables such as proximity to other qubits and user interaction.

# QIXR is now available on Meta Quest headsets standalone!
